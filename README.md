# Wordpress-Page-Refresh-Plugin
Plugin to refresh elements on a wordress page using java 
 load this folder into your wordpress plugin folder and edit css classnames in the java file and you should be good to go , you can also change the refresh time in the js file 
 
 this plugin was made to refresh the price on the woocommerce-auctions-master version: 1.0.0 so the users dont have to manualy refresh the page to see if auction prices have changed , so if should work out the box with this plugin but edit it for any other purpose you would like.
